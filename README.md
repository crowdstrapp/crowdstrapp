Crowdstrapp is a platform that makes business ownership a reality for the rest of us.
-------
This completely new business model can change the way businesses are started; putting ownership and profits within reach of the people who otherwise would never be in a position to take part.

The problem:
-------
A problem with the current startup model is risk. Since each company is founded by just a few people, the consequences of failure are huge. Going “all in” to build a startup is a life changing event. It doesn’t matter if the business succeeds or fails. Laying it all on the line for a startup is a huge risk that many cannot afford to take.

Starting a company also has a significant “luck factor.” Of course, a startup requires a tremendous amount of work and the people who are successful have definitely earned it. But for most of us, the chances are small that we will have the opportunity to make a startup work in a way that creates wealth.

This platform is an effort to make wealth creation possible for many more people than it is today.
Crowdstrapping Definition
--------
Crowdstrapping is the process of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrap.asp" target="_blank">bootstrapping a business</a> by distributing ownership among a crowd of people who all contribute to the success of the company. These initial owners provide the expertise that can not be afforded by a bootstrapping startup. Through the power of crowd ownership, the business has much greater access to talent and ideas. 
 
There are many crowd sites. Crowdfunding, crowd work, crowd design, crowd problem solving, just about crowd everything - except startups. 

A crowd startup is a collaborative effort, among a large group of people, to build, launch, and profit from a startup. Because of the distributed workload, owners don’t need to concentrate on each business full-time. Instead, they can hold ownership in a portfolio of companies, thereby increasing their chance of being involved in successful launches.

Owners are paid in cash according to their ownership percentage when there are owner distributions or a liquidity event, such as an IPO or being acquired, occurs. 

The founders, who formed the company and are guiding the overall direction, will offer a percentage of equity to a defined number of people. These are distributed companies - owned by the groups of people who help get them started. Owners can help with an unlimited number of companies, and are encouraged to do so. The idea is microworking - spreading talent out into different companies; giving people a greater chance at profiting by owning part of many tech startups.
Participate in the marketplace
--------
Once the platform is built, you can use it to launch a new company, or to find companies that you believe in and wish to help launch. In return for your contributions, you will be given a fixed percentage of equity as defined by the founder of each company.

We turned to GitHub to launch this because of the high quality of developers here and the wonderful projects you have created. We would like to take this concept a bit further. Equity is known as “The Entrepreneurs Retirement Plan” because as Entrepreneurs go along and take part in different startups, they gain equity in different companies. When one of these companies is very successful or gets acquired, there is a windfall of profit.

This process should not be limited to just people with the right connections. Imagine if over the next few years, you contributed to the launches of 50 different companies and earned a .5% equity stake in each. It may not sound like much but if a few of them become successful, you could earn significant wealth. If one of them becomes the next What’sApp, you would never need to work again unless you desire to do so. As an owner, you will reap all the benefits of the company making profits. Since you don’t invest money or have to quit your job, the risk associated with failure is greatly diminished.

Crowdfunding for equity is getting a lot of attention. But you are only eligible if you have a high net-worth. With Crowdstrapp, if you have a valuable skill, you can contribute to many startups in exchange for equity.
Be part of the future
--------
Traditionally, launching a startup requires a few founders to handle the many functions of the business. At least one person does the software development, another person handles the business/finance side of things, and perhaps another person takes care of sales. And because of the sheer amount of work involved, the founders try very hard to keep as much equity as possible. This leads to just a few founders becoming very, very wealthy if the company succeeds.

Crowdstrapping changes that. Rather than concentrate all the equity into the hands of a few people at the top, crowdstrapping distributes the equity among a crowd of experts who help get the company off the ground. Instead of a few founders working day and night to launch the company, a group of people can contribute much smaller amounts of labor to get things going. This leads to a higher quality product and if the company does well, the entire group shares the profits. Eventually as the company grows, employees can be hired to take workload away from the owners, and the income becomes passive. 
Democratic, Distributed Companies
--------
Rather than a top-down approach, the owners will run the company in a democratic manner. The owners are not employees. You have a say in how the business accomplishes its goals. Each owner votes to help direct the business in their specific area. You wouldn’t want a finance or marketing expert telling you how to write the code. So, each part of the company has autonomy to decide how to meet the goals of the business. 
Let’s Crowdstrapp the platform.
--------
We truly believe this business model can change lives. Maybe it will change yours. Come help build the platform and gain an equity stake in Crowdstrapp. We want to build Crowdstrapp using the exact same crowdstrapping process as the companies we will host. This will give us clear insight into the needs and issues presented by this new business model. The platform will consist of a way to distribute and track equity, and eventually the management tools to help the company make decisions.

Typically, working for equity creates a lot of risk. We have identified five major reasons why. Please feel free to help us add more.
1. It’s risky for the service provider - the company may fail - *__Crowdstrapping spreads this risk through diversification__*
2. Time consuming - working for equity takes as much (or more) time as a full paying client - *__by spreading small chunks of equity to more people, crowdstrapping distributes the workload among more people who are performing tasks.__* 
3. Responsibility - when the full responsibility for results is heaped upon one person - it can seem a very heavy burden for something that might not pay off. *__With crowdstrapping, no project depends upon just a few people. With the power of the crowd, decisions can be made by voting, and work contributions will be shared among many.__*
4. It’s risky for the company - what if the service provider doesn’t work out? *__Crowdstrapping spreads this risk through diversification.__*
5. Opportunity costs for the company and the service provider - time and energy is diverted away from other people and projects that may be much more profitable. *__Crowdstrapping spreads this risk through diversification.__*

Are you in?
--------
I hope you are interested in this project and can see the potential of this platform to change the world for the better. Decentralized, democratic companies built in the crowd is a practical step forward. 

Please ask any questions you have. Your input is valuable and this idea will succeed only if we work together.
